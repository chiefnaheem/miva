# ðŸ§ª Technical Test Solutions

This repository contains solutions for two Python coding problems:

1. **Plus One** â€“ Increment a number represented as an array of digits.
2. **Alternate Min-Max Rearrangement** â€“ Rearrange an array to alternate between the smallest, largest, second-smallest, second-largest, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Descriptions

### 1. Plus One

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the i-th digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant (left to right). The large integer does not contain any leading zeros.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

**Examples:**

- Input: `[1, 2, 3]` â†’ Output: `[1, 2, 4]`
- Input: `[4, 3, 2, 1]` â†’ Output: `[4, 3, 2, 2]`
- Input: `[9]` â†’ Output: `[1, 0]`

### 2. Alternate Min-Max Rearrangement

Modify a given array of integers so that:

- The first element is the smallest,
- The second is the largest,
- The third is the second-smallest,
- The fourth is the second-largest,
- And so on.

**Examples:**

- Input: `[13, 7, 8, 3, 2, 10, 15, -1]` â†’ Output: `[-1, 15, 2, 13, 3, 10, 7, 8]`
- Input: `[-5, -12, -1, 7, 14, -7, 3, 6]` â†’ Output: `[-12, 14, -7, 7, -5, 6, -1, 3]`
- Input: `[3, 6, 9, -10, -5, -2, 0, 8]` â†’ Output: `[-10, 9, -5, 8, -2, 6, 0, 3]`
